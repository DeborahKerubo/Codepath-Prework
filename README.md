## APP Brainstorming
-Application tracker app
I am interested in building an app that is a tool for job seekers. The app would help track the applications one has sent and store data on the number of applications sent and the steps in the process.It would have a defined data model to represent a job application which would include fields like job title, company, date applied, application status, and links (resume, LinkedIn URL, transcript, etc.).The app would have a user interface where users view and can update the information. Moreover, it would implement notification features for upcoming deadlines, interviews and follow-ups.It would also integrate built in functions to keep track/detect application links when one has submitted a resume or a LinkedIn link or transcript and use this as a way to update the user’s information.

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
The instructions were easy to follow through.
